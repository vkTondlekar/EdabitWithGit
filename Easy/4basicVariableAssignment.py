A student learning Python was trying to make a function. His code should
concatenate a passed string name with string "Edabit" and store
it in a variable called result. He needs your help to fix this code.

name_string("Mubashir") ➞ "MubashirEdabit"
name_string("Matt") ➞ "MattEdabit"

"""

def name_string(name):
	  b = "Edabit"
	  result = name + b
	  return(result)
